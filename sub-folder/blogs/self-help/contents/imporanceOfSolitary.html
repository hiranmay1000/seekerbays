                <p>We, as social beings, cannot live without the interaction of others. We need others' support,
                    guidance, and to provide warmth as well. <br> <br>
                    You might have been through such circumstances where you crave someone to be with you. Share their
                    good vibes, non-judgmental thoughts, commentary, laugh, and humor. It could be for a moment or time.
                    <br> <br>

                    Does it happen exactly? The answer is simply “no.” <br> <br>

                    When you do not get these things, you begin to ask. Why did that happen? Why is all this happening
                    to you only? And why are you not getting the things that you should get? <br> <br>

                    We are bound by some principles and laws in the universe. Our universe knows when, where, and how
                    much to provide to whom. <br> <br>

                <p>Everything in the universe happens for a reason. So, if you failed to see the truth at present, then
                    you should be patient, truly very patient. Because the dots connect at the right time, and it
                    demands your patience.<br> <br>

                    Because when we want and desire something based on current feelings or emotional state at that
                    moment, it might not be best for our future selves.<br> <br>

                    For example, vehicles or other machinery objects, it requires maintenance and timely off-work from
                    their services. Overuse can demolish them. <br> <br>

                    Similarly, we also need off-time and isolation in life. Even if you are an important person or a CEO
                    in a company, take a break. If your absence will make your career or company at a loss, then let it
                    be because not everything is in your control. As the proverb goes, “Anything you want and don't get
                    then maybe it could be a Blessing in disguise.” If necessary, then take a year's break. Live alone,
                    be only with your faculty, feel every bad in yourself. It might sound frustrating and intimidating,
                    but once you taste the feeling of solitariness, you will get the secret of living a peaceful and
                    fulfilling life.<br> <br>

                    The feeling of living alone is only experienced. I suggest you take your first step and cut yourself
                    with rest, by letting go others regardless of their harsh treatment. This is an opportunity for you
                    to act and stand out from the rest, who are simply wasting the universal faculty.<br> <br>

                    So, taking time for yourself is not a selfish act at all. You are your own hero; sometimes you get
                    help from your circumstances (parents) but eventually you must take your own responsibility to make
                    your life charming.<br> <br>
