                <p>You never have to change others, because it is impossible even for the creator to make us change. May
                    be that's why we got life, to understand the fundamentals, truth, reality etc. <br> <br>
                    It will be a foolish act if you try to do so, because we only learn through ourselves by our own
                    actions. It is okay to see the consequences by taking such action but never to become obsessive to
                    make others life better. They are already in their better conditon. The only thing we should focus
                    on trying to make our own life best rather than others. <br> <br>
                    Sometimes this kind of incident takes place unconsciously. Thus, blaming yourself for the actions
                    you have taken, and regreting for not got the desired outcomes is a waste of time.</p>
